# HTML-Git-CSS: Code Refactor Homework 1 

## Description
As a part of the marketing agency for Horiseon, the website codebase has been refactored
so that it is more accessible and also more optimized for search engines. The codebase
has also been looked over and improved upon so that is sustainable in the long-term. 
The website's codebase has been improved upon so that the links work and makes it easier 
to navigate the website. In the end, the website maintains its easy to understand format
while the code has been updated and condensed. There was some difficulty in adding an alt 
for the image that was originally labeled as "hero" since the link to the image is in the 
style.css file. Figure title was used as I could not figure out another way to add an alt.
